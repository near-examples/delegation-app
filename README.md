Delegation App
=================================

## Quick Install
- `yarn`
- `yarn dev`
App should be running on http://localhost:1234 with parcel

### You will need
- a web wallet https://wallet.nearprotocol.com/

## Deploy your own contract
- make sure you have `near-shell` installed
- `npm i -g near-shell`
```
# using the account MY_OWNER (that's you)
$ near login
$ near create_account MY_VALIDATOR --masterAccount=mattlock
$ near deploy --accountId=MY_VALIDATOR --wasmFile=out/main.wasm
# using public_key from command $ near keys MY_VALIDATOR
$ near call MY_VALIDATOR new '{"owner_id": "MY_OWNER", "stake_public_key": "688rqcoMGi2pZX3s8Bc9E945e3DAtqHUMHhuohmKftM6", "reward_fee_fraction": {"numerator": 10, "denominator": 100}}' --account_id MY_OWNER
```

## High Level Overview (understanding this example)
- on the initial app mount, all validator contracts have their state read to get the `staked` and `unstaked` near
- all state updates are done via hooks to functions in `redux/near` or `redux/validator`
- anything related to validator state changes in the app or contract are made in `redux/validator`
- there is no need to sign in / out of each contract, since each action will require approval (stake moves near tokens and withdraw, while not moving tokens requires only 1 more approval) the user is potentially interacting with several contracts
- A contract is the `selectedContract` via a hook that updates state in `redux/validator.js`
- Subsequent hooks dispatched rely on `selectedContract` in order to determine which contract `view` or `change` methods should be called on. This also happens in `redux/validator.js`
- There is no routing.
- All components and validator views are in `/components`

## App.js
- Handles the initial mount with `useEffect`
- Calls `initNear` and `initValidators` in their respective `redux/` files
- Handles `signIn` and `signOut` hooks
- Uses `connect` to connect `nearState` and `validatorState` to the props and passes these props to the child components.
- As a single page app, all children receive all props

## redux/near.js
- Manages the connection to nearAPI
- Handles signIn and signOut actions
- Check value of currentUser to see if user is signed in or not

## redux/validator.js
- Maintains the `selectedContract` and `selectedAction` determining how views call hooks and which contract is called when a hook is dispatched from a view
- `contracts` is an object storing all the contract instances that is initialized `initValidators`

## Changelog 15-05-2020
- moved validator contract calls to `redux/validator.js` this is the go to for contract state, which validator is selected, etc...
- still NOT using a router (don't need one RN)
- broke validator state into 3 component views: Unstaked, Staked, Selected

## Changelog 13/14-05-2020
- moved all near calls to redux, redux-thunk
- added styled components
- still NOT using a router (don't need one RN)
- check components (Header/Validator/...) and their use of hooks for state changes
- check `redux/near` for information about state and actions

<!-- MAGIC COMMENT: DO NOT DELETE! Everything above this line is hidden on NEAR Examples page -->

## Description

This contract implements simple counter backed by storage on blockchain.
Contract in `contract/src/lib.rs` provides methods to increment / decrement counter and get it's current value or reset.

Plus and minus buttons increase and decrease value correspondingly. When button L is toggled, a little light turns on, just for fun. RS button is for reset. LE and RE buttons to let the robot wink at you.

## To Run
Open in the Gitpod link above or clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/rust-counter
```


## Setup [Or skip to Login if in Gitpod](#login)
Install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

Make sure you have `near-shell` by running:

```
near --version
```

If you need to install `near-shell`:

```
npm install near-shell -g
```

## Login
If you do not have a NEAR account, please create one with [NEAR Wallet](https://wallet.nearprotocol.com).

In the project root, login with `near-shell` by following the instructions after this command:

```
near login
```

Modify the top of `src/config.js`, changing the `CONTRACT_NAME` to be the NEAR account that was just used to log in.

```javascript
…
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME_HERE'; /* TODO: fill this in! */
…
```

Start the example!

```
yarn start
```

## To Test

```
cd contract
cargo test -- --nocapture
```
